[Am]Alas my love, you [G]do me wrong
[F]to cast me off so [E7]discourteously,
[Am]for I have loved you [G]for so long,
[F]delighting [E7]in your [Am]company.

[C]Greensleeves was [G]all my joy,
[F]Greensleeves was [E7]my delight,
[C]Greensleeves was my [G]heart of gold,
and [F]who but my [E7]lady [Am]Greensleeves.
